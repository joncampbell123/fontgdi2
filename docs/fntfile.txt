FONTGDI 'FNT' file format:

The FNT header looks like this:

    'FONT'              (4 bytes)
    character height    (1 byte)
    display height      (1 byte)
    # of characters     (1 word = 2 bytes)
    [character def #0]  (# of bytes = character height)
    [character def #1]  (# of bytes = character height)
        ...

    That's it. That's the FONTGDI FNT file format.
    All the characters are represented as 8-pixel wide monochrome bitmaps.
    This means one scan line = 1 byte. The number of scan lines is defined
    by the character height.
